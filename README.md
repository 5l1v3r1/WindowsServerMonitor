# WindowsServerMonitor
A small windows service which can monitor and graph performance counters remotely.  The main benefits over Windows' native Performance Monitor app are that it remembers your configuration and it can monitor processes even if the process ID changes due to the process restarting.  The main downside is that this app is difficult to configure.
